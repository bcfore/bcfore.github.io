## Some environment settings ##

Since I'm switching between dev computers it's helpful to store some settings here.

* .bashrc - Goes in your home directory.
* .inputrc - Also in your home directory. This contains the preferences for your command-line editing. The main things for me are setting it to Vim-style, and tab-autocomplete without having to press tab twice.
