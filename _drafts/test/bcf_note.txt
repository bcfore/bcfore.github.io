A lot of the content and all of the styling here is provided by the
default theme.

To see where those files are located, run:

bundle show minima

Currently that returns:

/home/bcfore/.rbenv/versions/2.3.1/lib/ruby/gems/2.3.0/gems/minima-2.1.1

If you wanted to override any of them, then you'd mimic the directory
structure and filename locally, and write the content that you wanted.

I copied all of the minima theme's files and directories to here,
to use for comparison when setting up my site.
