  <h3>About me</h3>

  <p>I'm a full stack web developer new to Scottsdale, Arizona, looking for employment in the Phoenix area.</p>

  <p>I studied physics and math as an undergraduate at SLU, then earned a doctorate in theoretical physics from MIT. I then transitioned to quantitative finance, working for ING Belgium in trading risk management. After nearly a decade in Brussels, I moved back to the States to study for a career in web development.</p>

  <h3>Web development</h3>

  <p>I've been taking online courses through <a href="https://launchschool.com/">Launch School</a> for about a year now (as of July 2017), with about a 50/50 split between front-end and back-end work.</p>

  <p>The emphasis at Launch School is on mastering the fundamentals. You can read more about their teaching philosophy <a href="https://launchschool.com/is_this_for_me">here</a>. This approach worked well for me. I want my understanding of the fundamental concepts to be strong enough that I can not only use higher-level frameworks, but implement them myself when needed.</p>

  <p>The back-end courses focused on Ruby. I also solidified my knowledge of SQL (I already had a good grasp of SQL from my career in finance) and learned how to deploy to Heroku. The front-end courses focused on JavaScript, jQuery, and Backbone (in addition to the fundamentals of HTML and CSS).</p>

  <p>See my <a href="{% link pages/projects.html %}">Projects</a> page for links to some of the work I've done.</p>
